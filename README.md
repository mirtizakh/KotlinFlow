### Guide Line And Video Link

### What is Kotlin Flow
* It is a KOtlin language feature that serves as reactive programming framework.
* It's all about being notified about changes in your code and sending them through a pipeline that potentially modifies them.
* A flow is a coroutine that can emit values over a period of time.

### What is Kotlin Flow Operator
* It is just something that decides what happens with an emission of a flow.
* We can apply operators to actually transform our emissions for example is not only for transform emissions but that is one part of flow operators.
* We also have terminate flow operators which are used to terminate the flow.
* Flatten flows, if we have two flows then we can combine these to have the results coming in a single flow.
